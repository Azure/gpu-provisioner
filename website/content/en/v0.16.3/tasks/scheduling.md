  Learn about scheduling workloads with Karpenter
---

If your pods have no requirements for how or where to run, you can let Karpenter choose nodes from the full range of available cloud provider resources.
However, by taking advantage of Karpenter's model of layered constraints, you can be sure that the precise type and amount of resources needed are available to your pods.
Reasons for constraining where your pods run could include:

* Needing to run in zones where dependent applications or storage are available
* Requiring certain kinds of processors or other hardware
* Wanting to use techniques like topology spread to help ensure high availability

Your Cloud Provider defines the first layer of constraints, including all instance types, architectures, zones, and purchase types available to its cloud.
The cluster administrator adds the next layer of constraints by creating one or more provisioners.
The final layer comes from you adding specifications to your Kubernetes pod deployments.
Pod scheduling constraints must fall within a provisioner's constraints or the pods will not deploy.
For example, if the provisioner sets limits that allow only a particular zone to be used, and a pod asks for a different zone, it will not be scheduled.

Constraints you can request include:

* **Resource requests**: Request that certain amount of memory or CPU be available.
* **Node selection**: Choose to run on a node that is has a particular label (`nodeSelector`).
* **Node affinity**: Draws a pod to run on nodes with particular attributes (affinity).
* **Topology spread**: Use topology spread to help ensure availability of the application.
* **Pod affinity/anti-affinity**: Draws pods towards or away from topology domains based on the scheduling of other pods.

Karpenter supports standard Kubernetes scheduling constraints.
This allows you to define a single set of rules that apply to both existing and provisioned capacity.

## Resource requests

Within a Pod spec, you can both make requests and set limits on resources a pod needs, such as CPU and memory.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myimage
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "1000m"
```
In this example, the container is requesting 128MiB of memory and .5 CPU.
Its limits are set to 256MiB of memory and 1 CPU.
Instance type selection math only uses `requests`, but `limits` may be configured to enable resource oversubscription.


See [Managing Resources for Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) for details on resource types supported by Kubernetes, [Specify a memory request and a memory limit](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/#specify-a-memory-request-and-a-memory-limit) for examples of memory requests, and [Provisioning Configuration](../../aws/provisioning/) for a list of supported resources.


## Selecting nodes

With `nodeSelector` you can ask for a node that matches selected key-value pairs.
This can include well-known labels or custom labels you create yourself.

You can use `affinity` to define more complicated constraints, see [Node Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity) for the complete specification.

### Supported Labels
The following labels are supported by Karpenter. They may be specified as provisioner requirements or pod scheduling constraints. You can also define your own custom labels by specifying `requirements` or `labels` on your Provisioner and select them using `nodeAffinity` or `nodeSelectors` on your Pods.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Take care to ensure the label domains are correct. A well known label like `karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family` will enforce node properties, but may be confused with `node.kubernetes.io/instance-family`, which is unknown to Karpenter, and treated as a custom label which will not enforce node properties.

### Node selectors

Here is an example of a `nodeSelector` for selecting nodes:

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  topology.kubernetes.io/zone: us-west-2a
  karpenter.sh/capacity-type: spot
```
This example features a well-known label (`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`) and a label that is well known to Karpenter (`karpenter.sh/capacity-type`).

If you want to create a custom label, you should do that at the provisioner level.
Then the pod can declare that custom label.


See [nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) in the Kubernetes documentation for details.

### Node affinity

Examples below illustrate how to use Node affinity to include (`In`) and exclude (`NotIn`) objects.
See [Node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity) for details.
When setting rules, the following Node affinity types define how hard or soft each rule is:

* **requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: This is a hard rule that must be met.
* **preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: This is a preference, but the pod can run on a node where it is not guaranteed.

The `IgnoredDuringExecution` part of each tells the pod to keep running, even if conditions change on the node so the rules no longer matched.
You can think of these concepts as `required` and `preferred`, since Kubernetes never implemented other variants of these rules.

All examples below assume that the provisioner doesn't have constraints to prevent those zones from being used.
The first constraint says you could use `us-west-2a` or `us-west-2b`, the second constraint makes it so only `us-west-2b` can be used.

```yaml
 affinity:
   nodeAffinity:
     requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
       nodeSelectorTerms:
         - matchExpressions:
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
             operator: "In"
             values: ["us-west-2a, us-west-2b"]
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
             operator: "In"
             values: ["us-west-2b"]
```

Changing the second operator to `NotIn` would allow the pod to run in `us-west-2a` only:

```yaml
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
             operator: "In"
             values: ["us-west-2a, us-west-2b"]
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
             operator: "NotIn"
             values: ["us-west-2b"]
```

Continuing to add to the example, `nodeAffinity` lets you define terms so if one term doesn't work it goes to the next one.
Here, if `us-west-2a` is not available, the second term will cause the pod to run on a spot instance in `us-west-2d`.


```yaml
 affinity:
   nodeAffinity:
     requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
       nodeSelectorTerms:
         - matchExpressions: # OR
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" # AND
             operator: "In"
             values: ["us-west-2a, us-west-2b"]
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" # AND
             operator: "NotIn"
             values: ["us-west-2b"]
         - matchExpressions: # OR
           - key: "karpenter.sh/capacity-type" # AND
             operator: "In"
             values: ["spot"]
           - key: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" # AND
             operator: "In"
             values: ["us-west-2d"]
```
In general, Karpenter will go through each of the `nodeSelectorTerms` in order and take the first one that works.
However, if Karpenter fails to provision on the first `nodeSelectorTerms`, it will try again using the second one.
If they all fail, Karpenter will fail to provision the pod.
Karpenter will backoff and retry over time.
So if capacity becomes available, it will schedule the pod without user intervention.

## Taints and tolerations

Taints are the opposite of affinity.
Setting a taint on a node tells the scheduler to not run a pod on it unless the pod has explicitly said it can tolerate that taint.
This example shows a Provisioner that was set up with a taint for only running pods that require a GPU, such as the following:


```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: gpu
spec:
  requirements:
  - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-family
    operator: In
    values:
      - p3
  taints:
  - key: nvidia.com/gpu
    value: true
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

For a pod to request to run on a node that has provisioner, it could set a toleration as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mygpupod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: gpuapp
    resources:
      requests:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
    image: mygpucontainer
  tolerations:
  - key: "nvidia.com/gpu"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
See [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) in the Kubernetes documentation for details.

## Topology Spread

By using the Kubernetes `topologySpreadConstraints` you can ask the provisioner to have pods push away from each other to limit the blast radius of an outage.
Think of it as the Kubernetes evolution for pod affinity: it lets you relate pods with respect to nodes while still allowing spread.
For example:

```yaml
spec:
  topologySpreadConstraints:
    - maxSkew: 1
      topologyKey: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"
      whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          dev: jjones
    - maxSkew: 1
      topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          dev: jjones
    - maxSkew: 1
      topologyKey: "karpenter.sh/capacity-type"
      whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
      labelSelector:
        matchLabels:
          dev: jjones

```
Adding this to your podspec would result in:

* Pods being spread across zones, hosts, and capacity-type (`topologyKey`).
* The `dev` `labelSelector` will include all pods with the label of `dev=jjones` in topology calculations. It is recommended to use a selector to match all pods in a deployment.
* No more than one pod difference in the number of pods on each host (`maxSkew`).
For example, if there were three nodes and five pods the pods could be spread 1, 2, 2 or 2, 1, 2 and so on.
If instead the spread were 5, pods could be 5, 0, 0 or 3, 2, 0, or 2, 1, 2 and so on.

The three supported `topologyKey` values that Karpenter supports are:
- `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
- `kubernetes.io/hostname`
- `karpenter.sh/capacity-type`


See [Pod Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/) for details.

## Pod affinity/anti-affinity

By using the `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity` configuration on a pod spec, you can inform the provisioner of your desire for pods to schedule together or apart with respect to different topology domains. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: system
            operator: In
            values:
            - backend
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: inflate
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

The above pod affinity rule would cause the pod to only schedule in zones where a pod with the label `system=backend` is already running.

The anti-affinity rule would cause it to avoid running on any node with a pod labeled `app=inflate`.  If this anti-affinity term was on a deployment pod spec along with a matching `app=inflate` label, it would prevent more than one pod from the deployment from running on any single node.

See [Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity) in the Kubernetes documentation for details.

## Persistent Volume Topology

Karpenter automatically detects storage scheduling requirements and includes them in node launch decisions.

In the following example, the `StorageClass` defines zonal topologies for `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b` and [binding mode `WaitForFirstConsumer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#volume-binding-mode).
When the pod is created, Karpenter follows references from the `Pod` to `PersistentVolumeClaim` to `StorageClass` and identifies that this pod requires storage in `us-west-2a` and `us-west-2b`.
It randomly selects `us-west-2a`, provisions a node in that zone, and waits for kube-scheduler to bind the pod to the node.
The CSI driver creates a `PersistentVolume` according to the `PersistentVolumeClaim` and gives it a node affinity rule for `us-west-2a`.

Later on, the pod is deleted and a new pod is created that requests the same claim. This time, Karpenter identifies that a `PersistentVolume` already exists for the `PersistentVolumeClaim`, and includes its zone `us-west-2a` in the pod's scheduling requirements.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  containers: ...
  volumes:
    - name: storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: ebs-claim
---
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ebs
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowedTopologies:
- matchLabelExpressions:
  - key: topology.ebs.csi.aws.com/zone
    values: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ebs
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 4Gi
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
☁️ AWS Specific

The EBS CSI driver uses `topology.ebs.csi.aws.com/zone` instead of the standard `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label. Karpenter is aware of label aliasing and translates this label into `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` in memory. When configuring a `StorageClass` for the EBS CSI Driver, you must use `topology.ebs.csi.aws.com/zone`.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
The topology key `topology.kubernetes.io/region` is not supported. Legacy in-tree CSI providers specify this label. Instead, install an out-of-tree CSI provider.

{{% /alert %}}

## Weighting Provisioners

Karpenter allows you to order your provisioners using the `.spec.weight` field so that the node scheduler will deterministically attempt to schedule with one provisioner before another. Below are a few example use-cases that are now supported with the provisioner weighting semantic.

### Savings Plans and Reserved Instances

If you have purchased a [Savings Plan](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/) or [Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/), you may want to tell Karpenter to prioritize this reserved capacity ahead of other instance types.

To enable this, you will need to tell the Karpenter controllers which instance types to prioritize and what is the maximum amount of capacity that should be provisioned using those instance types. We can set the `.spec.limits` on the provisioner to limit the capacity that can be launched by this provisioner. Combined with the `.spec.weight` value, we can tell Karpenter to pull from instance types in the reserved provisioner before defaulting to generic instance types.

#### Reserved Instance Provisioner

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: reserved-instance
spec:
  weight: 50
  requirements:
  - key: "node.kubernetes.io/instance-type"
    operator: In
    values: ["c4.large"]
  limits:
    cpu: 100
```

#### Default Provisioner

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  requirements:
  - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
    operator: In
    values: ["spot", "on-demand"]
  - key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: In
    values: ["amd64"]
```

### Default Node Configuration

Pods that do not specify node selectors or affinities can potentially be assigned to any node with any configuration. There may be cases where you require these pods to schedule to a specific capacity type or architecture but assigning the relevant node selectors or affinities to all these workload pods may be too tedious or infeasible. Instead, we want to define a cluster-wide default configuration for nodes launched using Karpenter.

By assigning a higher `.spec.weight` value and restricting a provisioner to a specific capacity type or architecture, we can set default configuration for the nodes launched by pods that don't have node configuration restrictions.

#### Default Provisioner

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  weight: 50
  requirements:
  - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
    operator: In
    values: ["spot", "on-demand"]
  - key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: In
    values: ["amd64"]
```

#### ARM-64 Specific Provisioner

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1alpha5
kind: Provisioner
metadata:
  name: arm64-specific
spec:
  requirements:
  - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
    operator: In
    values: ["spot", "on-demand"]
  - key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: In
    values: ["arm64"]
  - key: node.kubernetes.io/instance-type
    operator: In
    values: ["a1.large", "a1.xlarge"]
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Based on the way that Karpenter performs pod batching and bin packing, it is not guaranteed that Karpenter will always choose the highest priority provisioner given specific requirements. For example, if a pod can't be scheduled with the highest priority provisioner it will force creation of a node using a lower priority provisioner which may allow other pods from that batch to also schedule on that node. The behavior may also occur if existing capacity is available, as the kube-scheduler will schedule the pods instead of allowing Karpenter to provision a new node.

## Advanced Scheduling Techniques

### `Exists` Operator

The `Exists` operator can be used on a provisioner to provide workload segregation across nodes.

```yaml
...
  requirements:
  - key: company.com/team
    operator: Exists

With the requirement on the provisioner in place, workloads can optionally specify a custom value as a required node affinity or node selector.  Karpenter will then label the nodes it launches for these pods which prevents `kube-scheduler` from scheduling conflicting pods to those nodes.  This provides a way to more dynamically isolate workloads without requiring a unique provisioner for each workload subset.

```yaml
  nodeSelector:
    company.com/team: team-a
```
{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
If a workload matches the provisioner but doesn't specify a label, Karpenter will generate a random label for the node.
{{% /alert %}}

### On-Demand/Spot Ratio Split

Taking advantage of Karpenter's ability to assign labels to node and using a topology spread across those labels enables a crude method for splitting a workload across on-demand and spot instances in a desired ratio.

To do this, we create a provisioner each for spot and on-demand with disjoint values for a unique new label called `capacity-spread`.  In the example below, we provide four unique values for the spot provisioner and one value for the on-demand provisioner.  When we spread across our new label evenly, we'll end up with a ratio of 4:1 spot to on-demand nodes.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
This is not identical to a topology spread with a specified ratio.  We are constructing 'virtual domains' to spread evenly across and the ratio of those 'virtual domains' to spot and on-demand happen to coincide with the desired spot to on-demand ratio.  As an example, if you launch pods using the provided example, Karpenter will launch nodes with `capacity-spread` labels of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. `kube-scheduler` will then schedule evenly across those nodes to give the desired ratio.

#### Spot Provisioner
```yaml
  requirements:
  - key: "karpenter.sh/capacity-type"
    operator: In
    values: [ "spot"]
  - key: capacity-spread
    operator: In
    values:
    - "2"
    - "3"
    - "4"
    - "5"
```

#### On-Demand Provisioner
```yaml
  requirements:
  - key: "karpenter.sh/capacity-type"
    operator: In
    values: [ "on-demand"]
  - key: capacity-spread
    operator: In
    values:
    - "1"
```

#### Workload Topology Spread Constraint

```yaml
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: capacity-spread
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
```
