## Enabling Github Action Runs in Your AWS Account

1. Deploy the [Cloudformation stacks](https://github.com/aws/karpenter/tree/main/test/cloudformation/README.md) into your account to enable Managed Prometheus, Managed Grafana, and the Github Actions runner policies.
2. Set the following [Github Actions environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows) in your repository fork under `Settings/Secrets and Variables/Actions`:
   ```yaml
   AWS_REGION: <region>
   ACCOUNT_ID: <account-id>
   ROLE_NAME: <github-actions-role-name>
   PROMETHEUS_REGION: <managed-prometheus-hosted-region>
   TIMESTREAM_REGION: <timestream-hosted-region>
   WORKSPACE_ID: <managed-prometheus-workspace-id>
   ```
3. Trigger a `workflow_dispatch` event against the branch with your workflow changes to run the tests in GHA.
4. [Optional] Update the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret to reference a custom slack webhook url for publishing build notification messages into your build notification slack channel.
